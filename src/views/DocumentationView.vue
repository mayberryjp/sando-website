      <v-expansion-panel title="What is Sando?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
            <strong>Sando</strong> is a robust network security & monitoring platform. Sando monitors network traffic through your firewall or router and detects potentially malicious traffic. It gives you complete control and visibility to your network security. Sando integrate with popular platforms like PfSense and Pihole.

      <v-expansion-panel title="How do I get started?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
            After installation, only flow collection is enabled. Please navigate to Settings -> Processes to turn on detection processing or any other processing you want. Additionally, turn go to detections and start turning on detections that are interesting. New Host Detection is a simple first detection to enable and start profiling your network. Once you get more familiar with the system you can turn on other detections.

      <v-expansion-panel title="What are known issues?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
             Netflow doesn't have any idea of network topology. It just records flows going in and out of an interface. Therefore, it's often difficult to distinguish between a client and server in a flow conversation. We do our best to make some assumptions but they may be wrong.
          </p>
        </v-expansion-panel-text>
      </v-expansion-panel>

      <v-expansion-panel title="I have port SSH whitelisted on my network for a host inbound and now all outbound flows for SSH are whitelisted too. What gives?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
             Yes, see above. It's difficult for Netflow to differentiate between clients and servers. This scenario is a potential risk. 
          </p>
        </v-expansion-panel-text>
      </v-expansion-panel>

      <v-expansion-panel title="Does Netflow increase load on my router/firewall?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
             We haven't observed any negative impact at normal netowrk traffic rates.
          </p>

      <v-expansion-panel title="What interfaces should I monitor and what netflow export interval?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
             We recommend exporting flows every minute. We recommend monitoring any interface that you want to monitor hosts and network traffic.

      <v-expansion-panel title="Do you support IPFIX or IPv6?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
            Not at the moment. Right now we support IPv4 and Netflow v5. In the future we plan to support IPv6 and IPFIX. 
          </p>
        </v-expansion-panel-text>
      </v-expansion-panel>

      <v-expansion-panel title="Why do I see Sando making outbound connections to the Internet?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
            Sando may make outbound connections for various reasons, including: communicating with our central API, downloading GeoIP data or reputation databases. These are all optional features that can be disabled in Settings.
          </p>
        </v-expansion-panel-text>

      <v-expansion-panel title="What are the default ports that need to be exposed for Sando to work?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
            The default ports that need to be exposed for Sando to work are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sando Dashboard: TCP/3030</li>
            <li>Sando Netflow Collector: UDP/2055</li>
            <li>Sando Local API: TCP/8044</li>
            <li>Sando Sinkhole DNS server (optional feature): TCP & UDP: 53</li>
            <li>Sando DHCP server (optional feature): UDP: 67</li>
          </ul>
        </v-expansion-panel-text>

        </v-expansion-panel-text>
      </v-expansion-panel>
  
      <v-expansion-panel title="Why isn't the threat score updating?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
            Threat score recalculates at the interval set for the Discovery Run Interval on the settings page. From Advanced settings, you can also manually force threat-score recalculation. 
          </p>
        </v-expansion-panel-text>
      </v-expansion-panel>

      <v-expansion-panel title="The actions bell is saying there's an issue. What should I do?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
            If it's not happening often then it may just be a transient issue you can acknowledge and ignore. If you see it happening very frequently then we suggest opting into all feature on the Collaboration page in Settings. You can also follow the Submit Issue button in the navbar. 
          </p>
        </v-expansion-panel-text>
      </v-expansion-panel>

      <v-expansion-panel title="What's the purpose of device tags?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
            You can use it for whatever scenario you want. One idea is to add a tag to help you track a physical location, or a VLAN assignment or even details about how you're securing the device.
          </p>
        </v-expansion-panel-text>
      </v-expansion-panel>

      <v-expansion-panel title="What's the purpose of the export device feature?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
            Right now there isn't one. But, we offer it as an option to see a device's full history of network and DNS activity and export all information we know about the device. 
          </p>
        </v-expansion-panel-text>
      </v-expansion-panel>

      <v-expansion-panel title="The Traffic Stats seem high, what's the deal?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
             The traffic stats are aggregrate traffic stats for the hour. They are not per second or minute traffic stats. 
          </p>
        </v-expansion-panel-text>
      </v-expansion-panel>

      <v-expansion-panel title="Can I run this on the same docker home as Pihole?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
            You can but you will not be able to use the SinkholeDNS feature as both applications bind to port 53. 
          </p>
        </v-expansion-panel-text>
      </v-expansion-panel>

      <v-expansion-panel title="What's the purpose of the SinkholeDNS server?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
           The SinkholeDNS server is an optional feature that allows you to redirect DNS to an internal process that responds to NXDOMAIN for every DNS query. Many IoT devices use DNS to "phone home". By pointing these devices to SinkholeDNS, you can effectively prevent them from phoning home.
          </p>
        </v-expansion-panel-text>
      </v-expansion-panel>

      <v-expansion-panel title="How can I delete all alerts and is it bad to do that?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
            During the initial installation and tuning process you may generate a lot of alerts. In the Advanced section of Settings is a button to delete all alerts. This is not necessarily a bad thing to do and we suggest recalculating threat score after also. 
          </p>
        </v-expansion-panel-text>
      </v-expansion-panel>

      <v-expansion-panel title="Can I delete all alerts for just a specific host?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
            Yes, there is a delete alerts for a host under each host details page. Click on a host in the hosting listing panel. 
          </p>
        </v-expansion-panel-text>
      </v-expansion-panel>


      <v-expansion-panel title="What is the enable/disable notifications button?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
            When going through the fine-tuning process you may want to enable all alerts for some hosts and disable all alerts for other hosts. You can achieve this by globally enabling alerting in Settings for each detection type and then selectively disabling alerting on a host by host basis. 
          </p>
        </v-expansion-panel-text>
      </v-expansion-panel>


      <v-expansion-panel title="I use VLANs with restrictive outbound firewall rules. Do I really need Sando?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
            Sure! We offer other interesting features like device identification, DNS profiling, DHCP Relay server, network traffic stats, etc. Sando can act as a source of truth for what's on your network!
          </p>
        </v-expansion-panel-text>
      </v-expansion-panel>

      <v-expansion-panel title="What is the best way to secure my network?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
            There is no solution for everyone as home networks vary greatly. You may have a flat network or you may have several vlans. We recommend using a firewall software like PfSense if you aren't already. The best practive is likely some combination of physical and logical seperations using VLANs especially for IoT devices, security cameras and mobile devices.
          </p>

      <v-expansion-panel title="There's a local device on my network and I don't know what it is. What should I do?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
            We provide some tools like auto-device classification, OS finger-printing, and network behavior fingerprinting to help assist you. But, often times only you will know.
          </p>

      </v-expansion-panel>

      <v-expansion-panel title="I see something on my network talking to something on the Internet that I am not aware of. What should I do?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
            These questions are not easy to answer and require a mix of researching, googling and using sites like shodan to try and understand if a connection is legitimate or malicious. In the future, we plan to offer more features to help with the investigative process.
          </p>
        </v-expansion-panel-text>
      </v-expansion-panel>

      <v-expansion-panel title="What's the purpose of the friendly name?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
            This is a name you can assign to a host that is more descriptive than the IP address. It can be used to help you identify the host in the UI.
          </p>
        </v-expansion-panel-text>

      <v-expansion-panel title="What's the purpose of the management link under edit host?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
            This allows you to access a device's management website via Sando. It's just a convenient feature that may be useful during the investigation process.

      <v-expansion-panel title="What notification mechanisms do you support?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
            For each detection category you can set it to alert or notify. Currently we only support Telegram notification. You can also retrieve alerts from the API at /api/alerts. If you want more notification mechanisms to be supported then please following the Submit Features link.

      <v-expansion-panel title="Do configuration changes go into effect immediately?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
            Generally, yes, although if you're seeing an issue then please restart the container. Some configurations like turning on and off processes or adding 'Other Networks' may require a restart. 
          </p>

      <v-expansion-panel title="Do you submit multiple local networks and multiple routers?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>

      <v-expansion-panel title="Can I aggregrate many sites into one Sando instance?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
            Probably, but we don't test in this topology so try and let us know how it works. You'll probably want to disable local flows detections. 
          </p>

      <v-expansion-panel title="I have other private and remote networks in my network that don't show up in Flow Explorer correctly.">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
            You can define other private networks in the Settings 'Other Networks' page. Multiple Other Networks are supported. Please follow the configuration instructions on that page.

      <v-expansion-panel title="I don't understand these NTP and DNS settings. Can you explain it?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
            Many networks have their own DNS and NTP environment to maintain consistent time. For example, Pihole and Chrony are popular docker containers for DNS and NTP. Sando supports the ability to detect devices that aren't using your local DNS and NTP infrastructure as one of its detections. You can set your local DNS and NTP servers in Settings. You can also configure Pihole and Chrony to use specific public caching DNS servers and stratum NTP servers. This ensures those applications are only using the servers you want them to use.

          <p>
             It's a host specific threat score. It's used by calculating the volume of recent alerts for that host. It is recalcuated regularly based on your site configuration.

      <v-expansion-panel title="How is the site risk calculated?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
             It is the average of all of the localhosts threat score.

      <v-expansion-panel title="Why don't you support better application security?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
            At the moment we don't support authentication or HTTPS and our API is not secured. We may improve this in the future. We expect people to run this locally and access it via their network directly or over a secure VPN. We don't recommend exposing Sando to the Internet.

      <v-expansion-panel title="Everything is reporting in the wrong time zone. How do I fix it?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
            Set the TZ docker environment variable to your local time zone. Our docker config examples demonstrate how to do this.

      <v-expansion-panel title="Device auto-classification is wrong. Why?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
            Device auto-classification relies on various factors, including network behavior and traffic patterns. It also depends on our platform having seen this device on a network before. You can help others by opting into device classification in the settings page. When you opt-in, your local device classificaiton details will be submitted to our cloud and then be stored for future classification performed by others.

      <v-expansion-panel title="Do you integrate with Pihole?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>Yes! Sando integrates with Pihole to provide enhanced discovery of your local network. Sando can learn about network devices via the DHCP and network devices API as well as match traffic patterns to DNS queries. We only support the Pihole v6 API.</p>

      <v-expansion-panel title="Your app looks like Uptime Kuma. Are you affilaited with Uptime Kuma?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>
             No. We just liked the simplicity of their design and made a similar one. We also use VueJS like Uptime Kuma does.

      <v-expansion-panel title="Do you integrate with gethomepage.dev or Home Assistant?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          <p>Yes! There are configuration examples on Github in the third party integrations folder.
            These are the currently supported stats that are emitted via REST API at /api/quickstats:
            <code>{"acknowledged_alerts": 0, "unacknowledged_alerts": 6453, "total_alerts": 6453, "unacknowledged_localhosts_count": 4, "acknowledged_localhosts_count": 44, "total_localhosts_count": 48, "ignorelist_count": 32, "average_threat_score": 32}</code>
